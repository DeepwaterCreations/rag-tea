RaG TeA, the Randomly Generated Text Adventure

Instructions:
So far, there's not much to do, but you can type 'north', 'south', 'east' and 'west' (or 'n', 's', 'e', 'w') to move in that direction. 'quit' will quit the game, 'look' will reprint the description (which is pretty boring at this point, but you can if you really want to,) and 'dance' will make you dance. 
The maze will keep generating itself around you as you explore it. You can map it on graph paper if you want, although there's nothing to see at this point - mostly I just want to show off my code. Next version should have room descriptions, I think. The coordinates above the room descriptions are for testing purposes, but I went ahead and left them in, since there's not much else to see. The start is at 0,0 and x increases to the east, y to the south. Later on, they may become a gameplay feature that must be earned through play. I envision a GPS item that can be picked up.
That pretty much covers it. Later versions will be more exciting.
